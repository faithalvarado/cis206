/*
 * Write a program that will include the following:
 * 1. A class that will store mountain details which will included the following:
 *    member for name
 *    member for country
 *    member for elevation
 *    have setters + getters
 *    
 *    A member function call toMeters that will take the elevation and convert
 *    the value from feet to meters and return the converted value.
 *    
 *    The relationship for feet to meters is 1 meter per 3.2808 feet
 *    
 * 2. In the main function of the main class (for java) create 7 instances of Mountain objects
 *    and put the mountain data from the table above.
 * 
 * 3. Put mountain objects in an appropriate data structure
 * 
 * 4. Write a method called minElevation in the (main class for java)
 * 
 * 5. Iterate over the data structure that contains the Mountain objects and print out the Mountain data above
 *    + addition with elevation in feet and meters
 * 
 * 6. programmatically print out the elevation and name of the shortest mountain (No hard code this)
 * 
 * data for mountain:
 * mountain: Chimborazo / Matterhorn / Olympus / Everest / Mount Marcy-adirondacks / Mount Mitchell-Blue Bridge /
 * Zugspitze
 * Country: Ecuador / Switzerland / Greece (Macedonia) / Nepal / United States / United States / Switzerland
 * Elevation: 20,549 ft / 14,692 ft/ 9,573 ft / 29,029 ft/ 5,344ft / 6,684ft / 9,719ft
